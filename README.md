# PowerKit Clothing

[Live Demo](https://lukereed1.github.io/powerkit-clothing/)

A fake clothing company website, built to practice the process of designing a mockup for desktop, tablet, and mobile, and then creating that design using TypeScript and React, ensuring it is responsive for all devices. It is only a single page application at the moment, with no backend. Buttons and nav links do nothing.
